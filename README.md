# Embedded-System-2-Car-Project

This car project was created and coded for my Embedded systems class (CECS 347). The car contains functionalities such as Phase Lock Loop (PLL), Pulse WIdth Modulation (PWM), and Nokia LCD. The coding languaged used is C++. The code is installed on a ARM Cortex Tm4C123 embedded system. The car is able to move forward and backwards with varying speed. The direction and speed is displayed on the LCD. The video below is the how the car functions without the LCD. The LCD is a later add on to the project shown in the video.
